<!-- Now, let’s try to understand the difference between a method and a computed property.
Both are objects. There are functions defined inside, which returns a value.
In case of method, we call it as a function, and for computed as a property.
Using the following example, let us understand the difference between method and computed property. -->

<!-- If we look at the values above, we will see that the random numbers returned from the computed property remains the same irrespective of the number of times it is called.
This means everytime it is called, the last value is updated for all. Whereas for a method, it’s a function, hence, everytime it is called it returns a different value. -->
