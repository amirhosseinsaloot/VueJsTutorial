<!-- VueJS provides options to add reactivity to properties, which are added dynamically.
Consider that we have already created vue instance and need to add the watch property -->

<!-- There is a property counter defined as 1 in data object. The counter is incremented when we click the button.
Vue instance is already created.

We need to use $watch to add watch outside the vue instance.
There is an alert added, which shows the value change for the counter property.
There is also a timer function added, i.e. setTimeout, which sets the counter value to 20. -->
