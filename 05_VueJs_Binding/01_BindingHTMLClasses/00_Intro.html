<!-- There is a div created with v-bind: class=” {active: isactive}”.
Here, isactive is a variable which is based on true or false.
It will apply the class active to the div. In the data object,
we have assigned the isactive variable as true.
There is a class defined in the style .active with the background color as red. -->
