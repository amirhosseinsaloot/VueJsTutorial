<!-- Vue Components are one of the important features of VueJS that creates custom elements, which can be reused in HTML. -->

         });
         var vm = new Vue({
            el: '#component_test'
         });
         var vm1 = new Vue({

<!-- In the .html file, we have created two div with id component_test and component_test1.
In the .js files shown above, two Vue instances are created with the div ids.
We have created a common component to be used with both the view instances.

To create a component, following is the syntax :

  Vue.component('nameofthecomponent',{ // options});

Once a component is created, the name of the component becomes the custom element and the same can be used in the Vue instance element created,
i.e. inside the div with ids component_test and component_test1.
In the .js file, we have used a test component as the name of the component and the same name is used as the custom element inside the divs.



We have also directly made the components a part of vue instance as shown in the following script : 

var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#component_test',
  components:{
     'testcomponent': {
        template : '<div><h1>This is coming from component</h1></div>'
     }
  }
});


This is called local registration and the components will be a part of only the vue instance created. -->
