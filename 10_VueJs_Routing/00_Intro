VueJS does not have a built-in router feauture. We need to follow some additional steps to install it.

Direct Download from CDN
The latest version of vue-router is available at https://unpkg.com/vue-router/dist/vue-router.js

Unpkg.com provides npm-based cdn links. The above link is always updated to the recent version.
We can download and host it, and use it with a script tag along with vue.js as follows :

<script src = "/path/to/vue.js"></script>
<script src = "/path/to/vue-router.js"></script>

Using NPM

Run the following command to install the vue-router.

npm  install vue-router

Using GitHub

We can clone the repository from GitHub as follows âˆ’

git clone https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router.git node_modules/vue-router
cd node_modules/vue-router
npm install
npm run build
