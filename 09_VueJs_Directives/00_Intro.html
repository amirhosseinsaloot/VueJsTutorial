Directives are instruction for VueJS to do things in a certain way.
We have already seen directives such as v-if, v-show, v-else, v-for, v-bind , v-model, v-on, etc.

In this chapter, we will take a look at custom directives.
We will create global directives similar to how we did for components.

Syntax
Vue.directive('nameofthedirective', {
   bind(e1, binding, vnode) {
   }
})

We need to create a directive using Vue.directive.
It takes the name of the directive as shown above.
Let us consider an example to show the details of the working of directives.

<html>
   <head>
      <title>VueJs Instance</title>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <script type = "text/javascript" src = "../vue.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
      <div id = "databinding">
         <div v-changestyle>VueJS Directive</div>
      </div>
      <script type = "text/javascript">
         Vue.directive("changestyle",{
            bind(e1,binding, vnode) {
               console.log(e1);
               e1.style.color = "red";
               e1.style.fontSize = "30px";
            }
         });
         var vm = new Vue({
            el: '#databinding',
            data: {
            },
            methods : {
            },
         });
      </script>
   </body>
</html>
<!--
We have used the bind method, which is a part of the directive.
It takes three arguments e1, the element to which the custom directive needs to be applied.
Binding is like arguments passed to the custom directive,
e.g. v-changestyle = ”{color:’green’}”, where green will be read in the binding argument and vnode is the element, i.e. nodename.
