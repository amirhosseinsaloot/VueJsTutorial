<!--
The name of the transition is fade. VueJS provides some standard classes for transition and the classes are prefixed with the name of the transition.

Following are some standard classes for transition −

    v-enter − This class is called initially before the element is updated/added. Its the starting state.

    v-enter-active − This class is used to define the delay, duration, and easing curve for entering in the transition phase.
    This is the active state for entire and the class is available during the entire entering phase.

    v-leave − Added when the leaving transition is triggered, removed.

    v-leave-active − Applied during the leaving phase. It is removed when the transition is done. 
    his class is used to apply the delay, duration, and easing curve during the leaving phase.

Each of the above classes will be prefixed with the name of the transition.
We have given the name of the transition as fade,
hence the name of the classes becomes .fade_enter, .fade_enter_active, .fade_leave, .fade_leave_active.
